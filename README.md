---

## **Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing NYPD arrest data from **January 2023 to September 2023**.  
The goal is to uncover trends and patterns in arrests through **data visualizations** and summaries based on:  
- Offenses  
- Age groups  
- Boroughs  
- Time trends  
- Crime categories

## **Key Objectives**

1. Identify the distribution of arrests across **age groups**, **boroughs**, and **crime categories**.  
2. Filter and analyze specific offenses (e.g., *Dangerous Weapons*, *Fraud*, *Robbery*).  
3. Visualize trends using:  
   - **Heatmaps**: Age groups and boroughs.  
   - **Bar Plots**: Crime counts by age group and category.  
   - **Time Series Plot**: Arrests over time.  
   - **Geographical Map**: NYC boroughs with a Folium heatmap.

## **Methodology**

- **Data Cleaning**:  
  Handle missing values and prepare the dataset for analysis.  

- **Feature Engineering**:  
  Extract time-based features (month/year) and geographical data for trend analysis.  

- **Visualizations**:  
  - Heatmaps: Trends by age groups and boroughs.  
  - Bar plots: Detailed insights into age groups and crime categories.  
  - Time series plots: Monthly arrest patterns.  
  - Folium map: Highlight geographical crime clusters.
