# Integrative Data-Analysis and Visualization on NYPD Crime Data Overview

---

# This project focuses on analyzing NYPD arrest data from January 2023 to September 2023.
# The goal is to uncover trends and patterns in arrests through data visualizations
# and summaries based on offenses, age groups, boroughs, time trends, and crime categories.

---

## **Key Objectives**

# 1. Identify the distribution of arrests across age groups, boroughs, and crime categories.
# 2. Filter and analyze specific offenses (e.g., Dangerous Weapons, Fraud, Robbery).
# 3. Visualize trends using:
#    - Heatmaps for age groups and boroughs.
#    - Bar plots for crime counts by age group and category.
#    - A time series plot for arrests over time.
#    - A geographical heatmap with Folium for NYC boroughs.

---

## **Methodology**

# - **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values and prepare data for analysis.
# - **Feature Engineering:** Extract month, year, and geographical data for trends.
# - **Visualizations:** 
#   - Heatmaps for age group and borough trends.
#   - Bar plots and time series analysis for detailed insights.
#   - A Folium map to visualize geographical clusters of selected crimes.

---

## **Visualizations**

# 1. **Heatmap:** Arrests by age group and borough, showing unfiltered and filtered crime categories.
# 2. **Bar Plot:** Crime counts grouped by age and offense category.
# 3. **Time Series Plot:** Monthly trend of arrests over the analyzed period.
# 4. **Geographical Map:** Folium heatmap to highlight NYC crime hotspots.

---

## **Time Series Plot**

# A line graph tracks monthly arrests across all crime categories.
# Insights include:
# - Peaks and dips in arrest activity during specific months.
# - Potential patterns influenced by seasons or local events.

---

## **Key Insights**

# 1. Heatmaps reveal the distribution of arrests across age groups and boroughs.
# 2. Filtering offenses highlights specific crime trends and their distributions.
# 3. The time series plot shows temporal arrest patterns across months.
# 4. Geographical heatmaps pinpoint crime hotspots across NYC boroughs.

## **Deliverables**
# ---
# - Visual representations: heatmaps, bar plots, time series plots, and Folium maps.
# - Summarized findings for each analyzed category, trend, and visualization.
